This is now live, and ready to play. The main format of the game has no bugs, but there can be some new bugs found later during the course of the game, I would love to get communicated with that so, that i can fix it asap.

### Collaborate
Definately, there is a lot of scope for a better user experience in this game. Would love to have some more helping fingers ;)
